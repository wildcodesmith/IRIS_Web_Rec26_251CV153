Hiii, <br> here is the mess website. The project is a frontend web recreation of the IRIS Mess Module dashboard, focusing on UI, usability, and feature flow as described in the recruitment problem statement.
In this project, I primarily focused on the frontend code.I basically make websites with html, css and js. I am not so expert in ux/ui design, yet with some help from ai chatbots , some from the iris itself to match the color and design combination and a lot of thinking of myself I tried to make best of it. <br>

Some of the shortcoming of the project : <br>
1. it only contains the frontend code. it doesnot contain any backend(for future...).
2. the mess-cut website is not completed completely so i didn't linked it to the main index file.
3. This is a mobile friendly website. it is not responsive for bigger screens. In future we will definitely work on that. <br>

Installation & Running the Project : <br>
Either go to  the link : https://wildcodesmith.github.io/IRIS_Web_Rec26_251CV153/  <br> <br> or clone the repository : 
1. open terminal on your desktop and copy : git clone https://github.com/wildcodesmith/IRIS_Web_Rec26_251CV153.git
2. now open the index.html html in any modern browser and enter the responsive design  mode (as earlier said it works and looks best on mobile screens) <br>
