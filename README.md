Hiii, here is the mess website. 
In this project, I primarily focused on the frontend code.I basically make websites with html, css and js. I am not so expert in ux/ui design, yet with some help from ai chatbots , some from the iris itself to match the color and design 
combination and a lot of thinking of myself I tried to make best of it.

Some of the shortcoming of the project :
1. it only contains the frontend code. it doesnot contain any backend(for future...).
2. the mess-cut website is not completed completely so i didn't linked it to the main index file.
3. This is a mobile friendly website. it is not responsive for bigger screens. In future we will definitely work on that.
